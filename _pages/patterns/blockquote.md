## Library & Prototyping
To implement accordion into the page you first need to create the content and settings. This can be done through the front matter or by using data files. (*read more about using data files and [Contentful](docs/contentful)*)

### Settings
Settings are optional parameters that can be added to control styling and to set a reference. The reference is needed for using multiple groups if accordions on a page.

| setting | value |
| bordered | true/false (defaults to false)|
| multiselect | true/false (defaults to false)|
| ref | allows any letter (defaults to a)|
{: .usa-table}

### Content
For authoring environments, it recommended that this is created as a list.

| name |  |
| title | <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> required |
| header | *optional* - displays an h2 element over the accordion body content |
| content | <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> required |
{: .usa-table }

### Front matter example
this example uses a multi-level array for using both content and settings. For settings, only add the items you want to change.
{% highlight yaml %}
accordion:
  settings:
    bordered: true
    multiselect: true
    ref: "z"
  list:
    - title: Accordion item 1
      header: item 1 header
      content: accordion item 1 content
    - title: Accordion item 2
      content: accordion item 2 content
    - title: Accordion item 3
      content: accordion item 3 content
{% endhighlight %}

### Add pattern to page
{% highlight liguid %}
  {{ page.jekyll }}
{% endhighlight %}

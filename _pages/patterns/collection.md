        First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King’s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.

        And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. ‘They must go by the carrier,’ she thought; ‘and how funny it’ll seem, sending presents to one’s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!

## The Design

### Spotlight

{% include patterns/collection/collection-html.md%}

### Funding

{% include patterns/collection/collection-animated-html.md%}

---

## Theme Settings
- $theme-collection-font-family - Font family of the collection.
- $theme-collection-header-typeset - Header typeset of the collection.

## Variations
Add class `.usa-collection--condensed` for a more condensed item presentation with less space between items.

## Code Examples
{% include partials/code-accordion.md %}

## Library & Prototyping
To implement collection into the page you first need to create the content and settings. This can be done through the front matter or by using data files. (*read more about using data files and [Contentful](docs/contentful)*)

### Settings
Settings are optional parameters that can be added to control styling and to set a reference. The reference is needed for using multiple groups if accordions on a page.

| setting | value |
| condensed | true/false (defaults to false)|
{: .usa-table}

### Content
For authoring environments, it recommended that this is created as a list.

| title | <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> required |
| description | <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> required |
| author | <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> required |
| date | <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> required |
| tags | <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> required |
{: .usa-table }

### Front matter example
this example uses a multi-level array for using both content and settings. For settings, only add the items you want to change.
{% highlight yaml %}
collection:
  settings:
    condensed: false
  list:
    - title: Collection item 1
      description: item 1 description
      date: collection item 1 date
      author: collection item 1 author
      tags: collection item 1 tags
    - title: Collection item 2
      description: item 2 description
      date: collection item 2 date
      author: collection item 2 author
      tags: collection item 2 tags
    - title: Collection item 3
      description: item 3 description
      date: collection item 3 date
      author: collection item 3 author
      tags: collection item 3 tags
{% endhighlight %}

### Add pattern to page
{% highlight liguid %}
  {{ page.jekyll }}
{% endhighlight %}
